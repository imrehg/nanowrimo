CHAPTER 1

"I'm not saying, it cannot be done, it's just not necesarily have to be done. Or at least not the way you propose it.
"Do you have any better idea? I don't"
They keep staring at the whiteboard full of sybols, colors, and diagrams, half of which they have already forgot what it meant. The other half, probably they have never known, just nodded in acknowledgement when the other was scribbling it there. That'w the way things are done in this lab, they both thought, but they wouldn't say it out loud. Fortunately the professor wasn't there. On second thought, it would be better if he was, since then everything would be resolved and it wouldn't be the fault of either of them. Lab meetings without professor are not the most proructive times.
"I think we need to check more papers. My intuition tells me, that it wouldn't work in practice. You have no idea how to assemble this design. I don't heve either, but got to think for a while". Well, at least half of what he said was true: Simon had no idea either. But not because he was seriously thinking of checking any more papers, pouring over books in the library or any such nonsense. It was because he genuinly had no idea. He's even surprised in the last two and half years they didn't discover that he didn't really have a physics degree. He didn't even have a science degree. He had a half-finished literature Bachlor's from.... from.... one of the universities he was crashing. It was half finished because there they realized earlier that he didn't finish high school. And now he's a PhD student in Prof. Langauer's lab, a proper forntier of science. For him this meant mostly fun blinking lights, lasers, and as many computers he could ever want to use. Though he had to wait to play games on them until the others went home. Which was way too late for his liking - that's the only complaint he had, that the others were just too hard working.
"Whatever, I will finish up the simulations and when Prof. gets back we can discuss." Jordan just wanted to finish this useless discussion. He had a nagging feeling that checking something with Simon never went anywhere. Just couldn't quite place it. He always had some comments that made him think he had an error in his calculation, or that he didn't think of something or that Simon is just arguing for arguments sake. Either way, things weren't going too well in the lab. We should all just finish up this work, otherwise it will never gets published, he was thinking to himself. Publication, a true capital letter word in his dictionary. From a family of university professors, one cannot expect anything else.
They were staring at the board a little bit longer that supposed to depict the design of their new experiment, then both turned their backs and went back to their desks.
Simon's place was fullof papers, he was hoping to suggest a "creative mess", but everyone else in the lab just thought it as a mess. On a second thought, he's just going to get another coffee, one is not enough to get through this day with Jordan trying to discuss things with him. While he was waiting at the hot-water machine to breathe some life into his instant coffee, he was thinking about his possibilities. He needs to read up more about those optical layouts, otherwise he'll find himself in trouble very soon. Not a good prospect, but studying wasn't a very good one either. What was he thinking when he bluffed himself in to this laboratory. It looked all fine, at least 6 or 7 years of research, unbothered, arcane science that few people dare to question because even fewer people understand. It was too good to believe it. Maybe it was indeed too good...

Jordan was just checking the checking the graphs from their last experiment when Simon came back. That awful instant coffee smell. He wasn't drinking coffee himself, milk tea is the proper drink for this time of the day. On the other hand, just forget about him and concentrate on the task. If the new expriment works out, just remember how many good Publications one could get out of it. It all came from the discussion they had last time with Prof. Langauer. Simon was hanging on his word every time, no other professor's lab he would liked to be in this much. The Prof wasn't around that much as he hoped to be, to learn from, to pick up some clues from, how one becomes a Great Scientist. It wasn't enough to know where he gets his great ideas from, that somehow always worked out in the end, no matter how improbable they looked in the beginning. There are still puzzling pieces, like how could he hire this no good Simon - but he must have had his reasons. Must have. Either way, just check out these equations, would this layout work the way he thought just before the meeting earlier?

Prof. Henry Langauer was in his office. Fortunately there were two doors to it, so he could sneak in whenever he needed, and didn't have to openly dodge any students along the way. He needed time to think. Not sure why, but there was something he had to think "up" from the corner of his mind. The whole morning it was bothering him, and now sitting at his table, shades half let down, and most of the outside hustle and bustle is muted by the padded door his professorship got him, made this the ideal environment to exorcise this nagging feeling. He was onto something, after years of searching, he felt he was onto something. Just not sure what it was. Did't dare to discuss it with other colleauges the detailes he decyphered, he didn't want to be ridiculed or misunderstood. Not sure which one was worse, but didn't want either of them. Not, at least until this nagging becomes too much. All he could do is to take pieces of the puzzle and feed them to his research assistants and students, who slowly, sometimes incruciatigly slowly, made them into reality in the lab. He couldn't do that, only just thinking them up. All this work for years has to add up to something, everything worked so far, like a puzzle picture where the corners are assembled but he still has no idea what does the whole picture depict. It cannot be too long, this last piece seems to be bigger than anything so far.
Sometimes he himself was thinking he is going crazy. How else he could come up with these these ideas and designs. Some of the fiends he was supposedly working it he merely skimmed through a few textbooks until the images in his head paired up with the symbols and he recognized them well enough to write them down. It was all in his head. Was it there from always, or is it new? Sometimes after an afternoon nap there's just a whole swarm of images that descend on him, other times nothing for weeks. At those times he has make himself busy, with increasing axiety, what does this whole thing mean, and did he miss something. There's got to be a meaning for all this. And every day he feels more certain that the path is all layed out, he just have to feel it out.
Since there were no new images, before him, just the department's courtyard through his window of his second floor office, he started thinking of the students he have. They must be part of it as well. Both Simon and Jordan made him feel very different from the other applicants when they came to the interview. If these years of unexplained plans bestowed on him taught him anything, that is that he cannot make this happen without the two of them. But what their role was, or even his own role was in what, is not to be revealed to him this time for sure. With a sigh he turned back to his table and phoned his secretary for the exam papers he supposed to correct this afternoon. That should be a task to take off his mind off these matters.

Ariadne was sitting on a bench in the courtyard. From her point she could see Prof. Langauer's office quite clearly. She have seen him staring out the window, and she new he didn't get it yet. Still, it can happen any day now, she might have to act sooner than she expected. She was still looking up when Simon was coming out of the department, spotted her there and started to come over. She run through her orders one last time, and quickly stowed them away in some remote corner of her mind, and turned to greet him with the sweetest smile she ever had.
"Hi, you are early"
"Yeah, well, had enough for today, not going to get much done with Jordan in the office. As usual. Let's grab something to eat."

CHAPTER 2

"That's not what the plan was"
"I know, but cannot do anything about it"
"You'd better, since that was your assigment. Doing something about it"
Ariadne didn't dare to look at his handler, standing right in front of her. Didn't dare to.
"He's not the way I thought him to be, not letting me nearly close enough to any of the work he's been doing. I don't know whether they are following what we planned for them."
"Then you should get creative, shouldn't you? What was all the training we spent on you, being able to fit in here, ready to facilitate to Plan? Also, remember, that this wasn't our deal. Unless you start producing results, you are in deep trouble."
She knew the meeting was over. Not because he said so, but since the familiar sounds of the cafe resumed around her. When she opened her eyes, she wasn't in the warehouse-looking place anymore but back sitting at the same cafe she has left, figuratively speaking", for the tough debriefing she has just been through. Simon was just sitting across the table, his full attention on the bagel he was eating. He wouldn't notice even if I had walked out and came back a half an hour later, she thought. Still, there was something cute about the way this silly boy, this big one of her troubles, were munching on his dinner. She shook her head, no, don't need this right now.

Prof. Langauer was looking around the lab. It wasn't exactly what I hoped but things are at least moving forward somewhat, there was all the preparation for the big experiment he was planning. Right now everything was quiet because the research assistants all went out for lunch. This is the time he liked to come to the lab, see thing for himself, withouth being bothered. Sometimes people are really so predictable, he thought, though he's not an exeption either. He was checking a few parameters on the monitors, amongst the slight humming of the machines doing their best. He was ready to leave when he turned and spotted the pot sitting on the corner of a whiteboard. He froze in his turn, how did that get here?  He was looking around instinctively and with increasing agitation. How's that potted cactus get in here? One thing he had no doubt about is who put it there. It was a sign he was dreading to see for a long time. He got so close accomplishing something - though not quite sure what, but now he knew others took note and had their eye on him. And their scrutiny is not something he wanted to have. He grabbed up the little pot and stormed out of the lab, don't even know if the he closed the doors behind himself. Back to his office, he has to think. And first of all, have to figure out what message that cactus contained.
He took a book off the far corner of his office bookself, and sat down at his table. Big, dusty, and full of pictures and description of cactii. He started to decode it, but not before locking his office door and lowering the shades of the window.
