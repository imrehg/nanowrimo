As the plane was accelerating on the runway I didn't feel as relieved as I hoped to be. The chatter of all those other people going on holiday or to meet friends or have a fancy business lunches idontcarewhere, just built a thicker and thicker wall around me. As we shoot out, it wasn't the reason why I took deeper breaths. These people, they all are headed to somewhere, while I was just leaving. Nothing to put in my calendar, I didn't even think whether I want beef or chicken for lunch. Everything was ending at that very moment. Back then when I arrived my calendar was also empty - but full of opportunities. Now I don't dare to look ahead.

Back when I landed the first time in Taiwan, it was a black box. No amount of books can prepare you for such a very different culture. And no amount of friendly advice can prepare you for what to avoid.

I had a backpack then, with just a few clothes. Yeah, knew how to travel light. Came for the adventure, I thought. Should be fun, teaching English is easy, they love the White Man over here, plenty of explore, I thought. Don't know if you don't try.

Saw the evening lights from the plane's window, the highways, the buildings, flying so low everything is already crowded. Getting a taxi was already nicer than at home, here they just line up one after the other, begging for people to take them. YMCA, that's the same in every language.

City center, and I don't know a word in Chinese.
